# Obsidian Beginner Vault Template

A template for a minimal [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/), focused on setting good defaults and VS Code-like hotkeys. If you want to try Obsidian for the first time or just get a barebones template, you're in the right place.

## Getting Started

To use this template, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Obsidian from [obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download).
2. Use this template by clicking the ["Use this template"](https://github.com/andrewmcodes/obsidian-beginner-vault-template/generate) button on this page and cloning the repo.
3. Open Obsidian.
4. Click "Open" next to the "Open folder as vault" label.
5. Select the folder you cloned the repo to.
6. Open `GETTING STARTED.md` and follow the instructions.

## Folder Structure

The template vault has the following folder structure:

- `_assets`: this folder contains project-specific files and folders.
  - `attachments`: this is where attachment files like images are stored.
  - `templates`: this is where template files are stored.
- `daily`: this folder is used for storing daily notes.
