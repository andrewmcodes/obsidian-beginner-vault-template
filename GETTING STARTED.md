## Cleanup Tasks

The final step is to clean up some of the project specific files from GitHub.

### Automagically

Run the following command:

```bash
rm -rf .github LICENSE README.md CHANGELOG.md version.txt
```

### Manual

- [ ] Delete GitHub folder `rm -rf .github`
- [ ] Delete [[LICENSE]]
- [ ] Delete [[README]]
- [ ] Delete [[CHANGELOG]]
- [ ] Delete `version.txt`

## Hotkeys

> Go to `Settings->Hotkeys` to see all hotkeys and add your own.

### Basics

- New note: `âŒ˜N`
- Open command palette: `âŒ˜â‡§P`
- Open quick switcher: `âŒ˜P`
- Open settings: `âŒ˜,`

## Theme

To install a new theme:

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go toÂ `Appearance`Â and clickÂ `Manage`
3. Select a theme and clickÂ `Install and use`

I personally use the [Minimal theme.](obsidian://show-theme?name=Minimal)
