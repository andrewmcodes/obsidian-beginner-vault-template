## Important Documentation

I would suggest starting with these documentation pages:

- [Creating Notes Documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Create+notes)
- [Embedding Files Documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Embed+files)

## Instructions

The final step is to clean up some of the project specific files from GitHub:

- [ ] _Optional_ Delete from git
  - `rm -rf .git`
- [ ] Delete GitHub folder
  - `rm -rf .github`
- [ ] Delete [[LICENSE]]
- [ ] Delete [[README]]
- [ ] Delete [[CHANGELOG]]
- [ ] Delete `version.txt`
